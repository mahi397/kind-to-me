# kind-to-me
 A kind browser extension created for a challenge in MLH Global Hack Week. Join in! https://ghw.mlh.io/challenges

## Inspiration
One google search related to *creating your own browser extension* later, I found that my idea can be the simplest but one that is important to me/fulfils my need. My need being constant nudges, regular check-ins with my own self, and re-reading my enlightening shower thoughts :P
I was determined to **complete** this one project, and didn't need external motivation for it! Enjoyed the process so much!

## What it does
Every new tab opens a page that shows me a kind, goal-oriented personal reminder, often part of my own self-talk. It picks one randomly from a list of reminders I fished out of my notes app/journal. Additionally it adds a nature background picked from a list of the ones I like.

## How I built it
Plain and simple JavaScript, CSS, HTML.

## Challenges I ran into
Mainly CSS struggles. Specifically, reducing the opacity of the background image using a pseudo selector.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Whipping up an MVP I am happy with, and having a starting point for implementing numerous ideas to improve it incrementally! I am most proud of completing it and typing out this submission form.

## What I learned
CSS pseudo selectors.
InnerHTML
window.onload
Random picker

## What's next for kind-to-me
- Improve the UI (text readability). 
- Right now it picks images from static files stored in a folder. I'd rather add an API call to fetch images randomly. 
- Also add node and separate out the list of reminders so it can be added to/customized easily. 
- Also think more from the perspective of designing for a consumer that's not me. Thinking about how it can be made customizable.
